Here we performed API Testing on postman. We generated two files Update Book Collection.postman_collection.json and Update Book Environment.postman_environment.json. In the first file where all API are assigned and we worked on all the data we received. Â In the second file we declare environment variables that connected with our collection file and worked properly. After generating two files we used postman for generating report file.
